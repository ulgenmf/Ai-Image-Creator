# A humble duplicate for DALLE AI

This app is a bit of demonstration of my skills.Keep in mind that I am still a beginner who wants to improve. Therefore I woould aproicate an honest or even  cruel critics. 


## Demo

Insert gif or link to demo


## Installation

After clonning the repo please run the ``` npm run dev ``` in client folder and ```npm start``` in server folder.

The urls might change in the future but you will see the log in terminal which host the app is using

```bash
  C:\Users\user\Ai-Image-Creator
  cd client
  npm run dev
```
and then 
      
```bash
  C:\Users\user\Ai-Image-Creator
  cd server
  npm start
```

make sure you still have 2 terminals on and running the local host client/server sides



    
## Acknowledgements

 Open-AI is no longer free and I might run out of credit.If you have problem with authorization that mean my api key is no longer valid.

 However you can sign up and get 18 $ free credir for new users. If you still want to make sure the app is working but the key is the problem you can easly locate to 

C:\Users\user\Ai-Image-Creator\Server\routes\dalleRoutes.js

and replace  the api key value on line 10 with your new key.
